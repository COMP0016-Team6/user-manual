Our app provides users with visualisation of feeding pump data with a dashboard and also storing these data for observations by clinicians. The following are some guides on getting familiar with the app: Register a user Give feedback as a patient Add patients as a clinician Change the treatment plan as a clinician Register a user To use the app, you will need to first register as a user. On our main Log in page, click the register button to open the register page. Here, you will be able to see the form that needs to be filled in. There is also a field to choose to register as either a patient or a clinician. Depending on the role, the details required will be different. Clinicians only need email, name and password, while patients will further require their date of birth, weight, gender diagnostic conclusion and the treatment plan detail. You may then click on the submit button to register, and if everything is filled in correctly, you will be now logged in and redirected to the Dashboard page. Give feedback as patient A patient can leave comments on the specific points on the graph clarifying what has happened. On the patient\u2019s dashboard page, there will be data points on the graph. You can click on the point that you want to comment on and there will be a popup prompting you to enter your explanation. Click submit and your feedback will now be visible when having on that specific point. Add patients as a clinician On the clinician\u2019s main page (the first page after you logged in as a clinician), click the Add Patient button. You should now see the list of all patients that are registered. Click on the checkboxes to add the patient that you are monitoring or uncheck the ones that you are not.

You can see the new list of patients by clicking the Back button. Change treatment plan as a clinician When you are reviewing a patient\u2019s data as a clinician, you may wish to alter their current treatment plan, i.e., feeding rate, energy intake rate.
